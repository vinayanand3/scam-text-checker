# Privacy Policy for Scam Text Checker

**Last updated:** June 11, 2025

This privacy policy explains how the Scam Text Checker extension ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information.

## Information We Collect

When you use the Scam Text Checker extension, we collect the following information:
* **Text for Analysis:** We collect the text content that you voluntarily paste into the extension for the sole purpose of analysis.

## How We Use Your Information

The text you provide is used exclusively to determine if it is likely a scam. The process is as follows:
1.  The text is sent securely from the extension to our backend service hosted on Google Cloud Run.
2.  Our backend service then sends this text to the Google Gemini API to perform the scam analysis.
3.  The analysis result is sent back to the extension and displayed to you.

## Data Storage and Sharing

We do not store the text you submit for analysis on our servers. The content is processed in real-time and is not logged or retained after the analysis is complete.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your submitted text to any third parties, other than sending it to the Google Gemini API as a necessary step for the analysis you requested.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page.
